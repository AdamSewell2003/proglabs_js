# Practical: HTML and CSS

## Aims

* Familiarisation with basic web functionality: HTML and CSS
* Publishing web sites at Durham

## Tasks

1. If you are not already familiar with HTML, read up about it on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) or look at the resources on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-and-css-basics). We are not going to be looking in detail at HTML5 features such as HTML5 forms, canvas, multimedia etc but feel free to have a look.

2.  Similarly you need familiarity with CSS on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) or [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-and-css-basics) including selectors and combinators, but not CSS3 specific features.


3. Write a one-page HTML document about the application of computing that you think makes the best contribution to society. You should include

  * A heading which includes text on a coloured background
  * A list
  * Some hyperlinks
  * A consistent, but non-default font
  * All style information in a separate CSS file

  Publish your HTML and CSS by placing them in the public_html folder of your J: drive and make sure you can access it through your web browser via
```
http://community.dur.ac.uk/username/filename.html
```
where you should replace the username and filename with appropriate values.

4. Make a copy of your HTML page and change it so that it uses either [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/). If you've used one of them before then try the other one. You should have to change very little of the HTML content, only the CSS classes referred to. Use templates that are provided in the documentation where relevant.

5. If you have time, make your page responsive for mobiles, by using 

 * a navbar (collapsible)
 * a grid layout for content

 Look in the documentation for examples of use.
