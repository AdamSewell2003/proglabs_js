# Practical: d3 

## Aims

* Build on d3 knowledge
* Explore existing code


## Tasks

1. First make sure you have completed the [SVG and intro to d3 practical](../svg_d3)

2. Work through the [d3js.org homepage](https://d3js.org/), specifically the [section on enter and exit](https://d3js.org/#enter-exit).

3. Adapt your SVG/barchart example from last week by adding an `enter` function, so that it creates the correct number of bars for the data that you provide.

4. Choose an example you like the look of from the [d3 gallery](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery). Get a copy of it on your machine and get it running.

5. Create a local git repository for this, and a linked remote repo on github. Add, commit and push your initial code.

6. Explore the code of the gallery example and try to understand what it is doing. You may need to read through parts of the [d3 API documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md). Try changing parts of the code, predicting what effect the change you make will have on the output, and seeing if you were correct. Add comments to the code explaining how the changes you make affect the output. Add, commit and push your changes.

7. Once you have some idea how the code works, try adding some new functionality. Maybe there are some parts of the SVG specification that you like to explore e.g. gradients.
