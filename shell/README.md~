# Practical: UNIX/Linux

## Aims

* Familiarising yourself with UNIX/Linux concepts and commands
* Accessing Linux at Durham

## Background

There are four main ways of accessing Linux in university computer labs

1. Use the putty application on Windows with get secure shell (ssh) access to mira.dur.ac.uk, the university Linux timeshare machine.  This will give you terminal access, and can be used from any internet connection in the world. putty and/or ssh is very commonly available so this is how I usually access mira and Linux.

2. Use x2go on Windows to get an x-terminal session on mira. This allows you to run graphics applications on mira, but can be a little slow because all of the mouse and graphics interactions need to be shared over the network, and the resource required to run mutiple X window sessions on mira (for multiple users) can make it slow

3. Some of the CIS PCs allow dual booting i.e. running Linux directly on the machine from boot-up. Access to this will depend on the lab you are in.

4. Use the git bash shell. We will take about this more in later practicals

If you are using your own machine you can either install putty (for Windows) to access mira, or run the Terminal application under OSX to get access to BSD (UNIX derivative) directly on the machine.

## Tasks

1. Try as many different ways as you can for accessing Linux/UNIX/BSD.

2.Then choose one of them and complete the UNIX tutorial at <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>
 
3. (Optional). If you are already familiar with UNIX/Linux and/or want to do more, then work through the examples in the lecture notes from the first lecture, covering slides 15-19.
