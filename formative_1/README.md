# Practical: Formative Groupwork

## Aims

* Familiarisation with git for collaboration
* Team work

## Tasks

This assignment is formative, so the assessment does not count towards the final mark for the module.

1. Choose a group to work with in your timetabled practical. Aim for diversity of teams: not just people like you. The best way to so this is to choose a partner that you know, then find another pair to work with who you don't know. Groups of three or four are best.

2. Choose a way of collaborating with github:

   1. One person approves changes, others make pull requests (fork?)
   2. One person owns the repository, others are collaborators
   3. Collaborators form an organization for multiple projects

   You might also like to choose a tool for planning the tasks, as outlined in the [lecture](https://gitpitch.com/stevenaeola/gitpitch/master?p=prog/git_collab#/6).
   
3. Develop a set of web pages describing applications of computing that make positive contributions  to society, linking with each other and to external pages where relevant. Include an index page and navigation links between the pages.

4. The pages should use a consistent theme based on a web framework such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

5. Each page should be authored by one group member, with author details included, but written by somebody else. Include links to the author's github pages and linkedin profile where appropriate. The university has some [guidance on using linkedin](https://www.dur.ac.uk/careers/students/careerplanning/research/socialmedia/linkedin/).

6. Once you have a good set of pages you can release them by cloning them into an appropriate sub-directory of your public_html directory.

7. Next week your work will be peer-assessed (and you will peer assess others' work) on these criteria:

  - Interesting content
  - Good consistent visual presentation
  - Good written presentation
  - Valid HTML
  - Author info not to be written by author
  - Balanced contributions from members
  - Not completed at the last minute
